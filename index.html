    What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force">Force</a>?</b></p>

    <p>In physics, a force is an influence that can change the motion of an object. Force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (e.g. moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newton (N). Force is represented by the symbol F (formerly P).

        The original form of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion"> Newton's second law</a> states that the net force acting upon an object is equal to the rate at which its momentum changes with time. If the mass of the object is constant, this law implies that the acceleration of an object;- is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object, is in the direction of the net force, and is inversely proportional to the mass of the object.

        Concepts related to force include:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust"> thrust</a>, which increases the velocity of an object; drag, which decreases the velocity of an object;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque"> and torque</a>, which produces changes in rotational speed of an object. In an extended body, each part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces through the body is the internal mechanical stress. Such internal mechanical stresses cause no acceleration of that body as the forces balance one another.

    What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure">Pressure</a>?</b></p>

<p>Pressure (symbol: p or P) is the force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area over which that force is distributed.: 445  Gauge pressure (also spelled gage pressure)[a] is the pressure relative to the ambient pressure.

    Various units are used to express pressure. Some of these derive from a unit of force divided by a unit of area; the SI unit of pressure, the pascal (Pa), for example, is one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-metre">newton per square metre (N/m2)</a>; similarly, the pound-force per square inch (psi) is the traditional unit of pressure in the imperial and U.S. customary systems. Pressure may also be expressed in terms of standard atmospheric pressure; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere">atmosphere (atm)</a> is equal to this pressure, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr">torr</a> is defined as 1⁄760 of this. Manometric units such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre_or_millimetre_of_water">centimetre of water</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre_of_mercury"> millimetre of mercury</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch_of_mercury">inch of mercury</a> are used to express pressures in terms of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_measurement#Liquid_column_(manometer)">height of column of a particular fluid in a manometer.</a>
